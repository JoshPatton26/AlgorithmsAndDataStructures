This repository contains all of my work that I completed in 'CS:303 - Algorithms and Data Structures' course at 
The University of Alabama at Birmingham. In this course we learned about Divide and Conquer, Recursive, Greedy, 
Brute Force and Dynamic Programming Algorithms. We also covered all the Data Structures from Arrays, Queue, Stack, 
and Linked Lists; as well as Trees, Graphs and Hashtables.
